Perform a thorough code review of recent changes for $1

Review checklist:
 1. [ ] Identify scope of review (git diff, specific files, or recent commits)
 2. [ ] Check code correctness and logic errors
 3. [ ] Verify error handling and edge cases
 4. [ ] Review for potential panics or unwraps that should be handled
 5. [ ] Check naming conventions and code clarity
 6. [ ] Verify comments and documentation are accurate
 7. [ ] Look for code duplication or refactoring opportunities
 8. [ ] Check performance implications (allocations, clones, loops)
 9. [ ] Check for proper use of Quest/Rust idioms
 10. [ ] Verify test coverage for new functionality
 11. [ ] Check for security issues or unsafe patterns

Focus areas:
- Correctness: Logic bugs, off-by-one errors, null handling
- Safety: Unwraps, panics, unsafe blocks, error propagation
- Performance: Unnecessary clones, allocations, inefficient algorithms
- Maintainability: Code clarity, documentation, test coverage
- Consistency: Style, patterns, naming conventions
