# Improvements Suggested from Session 003

## 1. Exception `.type()` API Clarity

The `.type()` method currently returns a Type object, not a string. Consider adding:
- `.type_name()` - Returns string like "ValueErr"
- `.type_str()` - Alias for type_name
- Or make `.type()` return a string and `.type_obj()` return the Type object

## 2. Exception Method Documentation

Add clearer documentation for exception object methods:
- `.type()` - What it returns (Type object vs string)
- `.message()` - The error message string
- `.stack()` - Stack trace array (what format?)
- `.str()` - String representation

## 3. Re-raising Exceptions

The test for re-raising exceptions works (`raise e`), which is great! This could be documented more prominently as it's a common pattern.

## 4. Exception Hierarchy Testing

All exception types (IndexErr, TypeErr, ValueErr, etc.) work correctly with the hierarchical catch system. This is working as expected!

## 5. Test Framework Output

The test output shows assertion failures in "Captured stdout" which is slightly confusing - these aren't actually test failures, just assertion output. The tests still pass overall. Consider:
- Making assertion error output clearer
- Or suppressing assertion details when test passes
- Or marking them differently (warning vs error)

## Overall Assessment

The exception system is quite robust! The main issue found was the `.type()` return value being a Type object instead of a string, which is more of an API design question than a bug.
