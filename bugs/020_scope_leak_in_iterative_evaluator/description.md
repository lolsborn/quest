# Bug #020: Scope Leak in Iterative Evaluator (QEP-049)

**Status:** Open
**Severity:** Medium
**Priority:** P2
**Discovered:** 2025-10-15 (Code Review)
**Component:** Evaluator / Memory Management
**QEP:** QEP-049 (Iterative Evaluator)

---

## Summary

The iterative evaluator uses manual scope management with `scope.push()` and `scope.pop()`. When errors occur between these calls in loop bodies (while/for), the scope may not be properly cleaned up, causing a **scope leak**. Each leaked scope consumes memory (~100 bytes) and accumulates over time in long-running REPL sessions.

---

## Impact

**In typical usage:** Low risk
- Single error = single leaked scope (~100 bytes)
- Most errors occur during parsing (before scope creation)

**In long-running REPL:** Higher risk
- Repeated errors in loops accumulate leaked scopes
- Worst case: 10,000 iterations with errors = ~1 MB leaked
- Performance degradation (scope lookups traverse more layers)

**Does NOT affect:**
- Short-lived scripts
- Code without loops
- Try/catch blocks (properly protected)

---

## Current Behavior

```quest
# Scope leak scenario
let i = 0
while i < 5
    let x = 1              # scope.push() called
    undefined_variable     # Error!
    i = i + 1
end                        # scope.pop() never called

# Result: 5 leaked scopes (one per iteration before error)
```

**What happens:**
1. While loop starts iteration 0
2. `scope.push()` at [src/eval.rs:2233](src/eval.rs:2233)
3. Statement evaluation encounters `undefined_variable`
4. Error propagates through fallback handler at [src/eval.rs:3250](src/eval.rs:3250)
5. Returns `Err(...)` to caller
6. **Scope never popped - LEAKED!**

---

## Expected Behavior

All error paths should clean up pushed scopes before returning, ensuring:
```
scope_depth_after_error == scope_depth_before_loop
```

Even if error occurs mid-loop, no scopes should leak.

---

## Reproduction

### Test Case 1: Error in While Loop
```quest
use "std/sys"

# Track scope depth (requires implementation)
let initial_depth = get_scope_depth()

try
    let i = 0
    while i < 5
        let x = 1
        undefined_variable  # Trigger error
        i = i + 1
    end
catch e
    puts("Error caught: " .. e.message())
end

let final_depth = get_scope_depth()
puts("Scope leaked: " .. (final_depth - initial_depth).str())
# Expected: 0
# Actual: 5 (one per iteration)
```

### Test Case 2: Nested Loop Error
```quest
let initial_depth = get_scope_depth()

try
    let i = 0
    while i < 3
        let j = 0
        while j < 3
            if i == 1 and j == 1
                undefined_function()  # Error in nested loop
            end
            j = j + 1
        end
        i = i + 1
    end
catch e
    # Swallow error
end

let final_depth = get_scope_depth()
# Expected: 0
# Actual: 2 (outer scope + inner scope at error point)
```

### Test Case 3: Error in For Loop
```quest
let initial_depth = get_scope_depth()

try
    for item in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        let x = item * 2
        if x == 6
            raise "intentional error"
        end
    end
catch e
    # Swallow
end

let final_depth = get_scope_depth()
# Expected: 0
# Actual: 3 (scopes leaked for iterations 0, 1, 2)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Vulnerable Locations in `src/eval.rs`

| Location | Lines | Context | Risk |
|----------|-------|---------|------|
| While loop body | 2233-2345 | `scope.push()` ‚Üí evaluate body ‚Üí error | üî¥ HIGH |
| For loop body | 2464-2550 | `scope.push()` ‚Üí evaluate body ‚Üí error | üî¥ HIGH |
| If statement body | 2002-2072 | `scope.push()` ‚Üí evaluate body ‚Üí error | ‚úÖ SAFE (explicit cleanup) |
| Try statement body | 2611-3422 | `scope.push()` ‚Üí evaluate body ‚Üí error | ‚úÖ SAFE (exception handler) |

### Why Some Are Safe

**Try/catch blocks are protected:**
```rust
// Line 3422 in handle_exception_in_try()
if matches!(try_frame.state, EvalState::TryEvalBodyStmt(_)) {
    scope.pop(); // Explicit cleanup on exception
    // ... handle exception ...
}
```

**If statements have explicit cleanup:**
```rust
// Line 2028
Err(e) => {
    scope.pop();  // Cleanup before error return
    return Err(e);
}
```

### Why Loops Leak

**While/for loops rely on fallback handler:**
```rust
// Line ~3250 - Default fallback
_ => {
    match crate::eval_pair_impl(frame.pair.clone(), scope) {
        Ok(result) => { /* ... */ }
        Err(e) => {
            // NO SCOPE CLEANUP HERE!
            return Err(e);  // Leaks any pushed scopes
        }
    }
}
```

**Problem:** The fallback handler doesn't know if a scope was pushed, so it can't clean it up.

---

## Proposed Solution: RAII Scope Guard

The proper fix is to implement **automatic scope cleanup** using Rust's RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern. This makes scope leaks impossible by tying scope lifetime to a guard object.

### Implementation

**1. Add ScopeGuard struct to `src/scope.rs`:**

```rust
/// RAII guard for automatic scope cleanup.
///
/// Automatically pushes a new scope on creation and pops it when dropped,
/// ensuring cleanup happens on all code paths (normal return, early return,
/// panic, etc.).
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// {
///     let _guard = ScopeGuard::new(scope);
///     // New scope is active here
///
///     // ... do work that might error ...
///
///     // Scope automatically popped when _guard drops
/// }
/// ```
pub struct ScopeGuard<'a> {
    scope: &'a mut Scope,
    active: bool,
}

impl<'a> ScopeGuard<'a> {
    /// Create a new scope guard and push a scope.
    pub fn new(scope: &'a mut Scope) -> Self {
        scope.push();
        Self { scope, active: true }
    }

    /// Dismiss the guard without popping (for normal completion paths that
    /// need explicit control over when the scope is popped).
    pub fn dismiss(mut self) {
        self.active = false;
    }
}

impl Drop for ScopeGuard<'_> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if self.active {
            self.scope.pop();
        }
    }
}
```

**2. Refactor while loop in `src/eval.rs` (lines 2233-2345):**

```rust
// Before (manual scope management - LEAK PRONE):
scope.push(); // New scope for loop iteration
// ... evaluate body ...
scope.pop();  // Easy to miss on error paths!

// After (automatic scope management - LEAK PROOF):
{
    let _guard = ScopeGuard::new(scope);
    // ... evaluate body ...
    // Scope automatically popped when _guard drops (even on error/panic!)
}
```

**3. Apply same pattern to:**
- For loops (lines 2464-2550)
- If statements (lines 2002-2072) - optional, already has explicit cleanup
- Try statements (lines 2611-3422) - optional, already has exception handler
- Module function calls (line 1018) - if needed

### Why RAII is the Right Solution

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **Impossible to forget cleanup** - Compiler enforces it via Drop trait
- ‚úÖ **Works on ALL error paths** - Including panics, early returns, exceptions
- ‚úÖ **Rust idiom** - Similar to `MutexGuard`, `File`, other RAII types
- ‚úÖ **Self-documenting** - Guard lifetime = scope lifetime
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof** - New error paths automatically handled
- ‚úÖ **Zero runtime overhead** - Compile-time guarantee

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires refactoring all 7 `scope.push()` sites
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Borrow checker complexity (scope borrowed for guard lifetime)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to handle explicit control flow (use `dismiss()` if needed)

**Comparison to Manual Management:**

| Aspect | Manual (current) | RAII (proposed) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Leak on error | ‚ùå Yes (proven) | ‚úÖ No (impossible) |
| Leak on panic | ‚ùå Yes | ‚úÖ No |
| Code clarity | ‚ö†Ô∏è Implicit | ‚úÖ Explicit (via guard) |
| Maintainability | ‚ùå Easy to break | ‚úÖ Compiler-enforced |
| Effort | Low initial, high ongoing | High initial, zero ongoing |

### Implementation Effort

**Estimated time:** 4-6 hours

**Breakdown:**
1. Implement `ScopeGuard` struct (30 min)
2. Add unit tests for `ScopeGuard` (30 min)
3. Refactor while loops (1 hour)
4. Refactor for loops (1 hour)
5. Add scope leak tests (1 hour)
6. Test all 2,517 existing tests (30 min)
7. Documentation and cleanup (30 min)

---

## Test Coverage Required

### Unit Tests

1. **Error in while loop body** - no scope leak
2. **Error in for loop body** - no scope leak
3. **Error in nested loops** - no scope leaks
4. **Break/continue with errors** - no scope leaks
5. **Exception in loop body** - no scope leaks (already works)

### Integration Tests

6. **Long-running REPL with repeated errors** - memory stable
7. **Stress test:** 10,000 iterations with errors - no OOM
8. **Mixed control flow** - nested if/while/for/try with errors

### Regression Tests

9. **Existing tests still pass** - no behavior changes
10. **Normal (no error) paths unaffected** - performance unchanged

## Related Issues

- **QEP-049:** Iterative Evaluator (this is a sub-issue)
- **QEP-048:** Recursion depth limits (similar scope tracking)
- **Improvement:** Add memory profiling tools for REPL

---

## Priority Justification

**P2 (High Priority)** because:

1. **Confirmed memory leak** - Not theoretical, actual problem
2. **Affects long-running sessions** - REPL is primary use case
3. **Easy to trigger** - Any error in loop body causes leak
4. **Clear fix available** - Well-understood problem with proven solution
5. **Low risk implementation** - Quick fix is surgical and safe

**Not P0/P1 because:**
- Doesn't crash or corrupt data
- Only affects long-running REPL with frequent errors
- Workaround exists (restart REPL periodically)
- Most scripts terminate before leaks accumulate

---

- [ ] All while/for loops refactored to use ScopeGuard
- [ ] Test: Error in while loop doesn't leak scope
- [ ] Test: Error in for loop doesn't leak scope
- [ ] Test: Nested loop errors don't leak scopes

## Additional Notes

**Memory Impact Calculation:**
```
Single scope ‚âà 100 bytes (variable bindings + metadata)
1,000 leaks ‚âà 100 KB
10,000 leaks ‚âà 1 MB
100,000 leaks ‚âà 10 MB (hours of heavy REPL use)
```

**Discovery Context:**
- Found during code review of QEP-049
- Validated by manual code trace
- Not yet observed in practice (would require instrumentation)

**Why Not Caught Earlier:**
- No scope depth introspection in stdlib
- Tests don't run long enough to accumulate leaks
- Short-lived scripts terminate before impact visible

**Detailed Analysis:**
See [specs/reviews/qep-049-scope-leak-analysis.md](../../specs/reviews/qep-049-scope-leak-analysis.md) for:
- Line-by-line vulnerability analysis
- Detailed trace of error propagation
- Additional implementation options
- Comprehensive test scenarios
