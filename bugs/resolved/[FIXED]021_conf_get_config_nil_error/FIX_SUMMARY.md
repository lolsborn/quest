# Bug #021 Fix Summary

**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Date Fixed**: 2025-10-16
**Fixed By**: Claude Code
**Component**: lib/std/conf.q

## Problem

When a Configuration type was missing the required `from_dict` static method, `conf.get_config()` raised an unhelpful `AttrErr: Cannot call method 'str' on nil` instead of the intended `ConfigurationErr` with a clear message about the missing method.

## Root Cause

The original code tried to raise a `ConfigurationErr` inside a catch block, but execution continued after the raise statement, leading to attempts to call methods on a `nil` config object:

```quest
# BEFORE (broken)
let config = nil
try
    config = schema.from_dict(config_dict)
catch e: AttrErr
    raise ConfigurationErr.new("Configuration type for '" .. module_name .. "' must have static method from_dict")
catch e
    raise ConfigurationErr.new("Error creating configuration for '" .. module_name .. "': " .. e.str())
end

# Run global validation if method exists
try
    config.validate()  # ← BUG: config is nil if from_dict failed!
```

This appears to be a Quest language behavior where `raise` inside a catch block doesn't immediately terminate execution.

## Solution

Restructured the error handling to capture errors in a variable and check it before proceeding:

```quest
# AFTER (fixed)
let config = nil
let from_dict_error = nil

try
    config = schema.from_dict(config_dict)
catch e: AttrErr
    from_dict_error = "Configuration type for '" .. module_name .. "' must have static method from_dict"
catch e
    from_dict_error = "Error creating configuration for '" .. module_name .. "': " .. e.str()
end

# Check if from_dict failed
if from_dict_error != nil
    raise ConfigurationErr.new(from_dict_error)
end

# Run global validation if method exists (config is guaranteed non-nil here)
try
    config.validate()
catch e: AttrErr
    # validate() method doesn't exist - that's okay
catch e
    raise e
end
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified File
- **lib/std/conf.q** (lines 158-185)
  - Changed error handling approach from "raise in catch" to "capture and raise later"
  - Added `from_dict_error` variable to track errors
  - Added nil check before calling `config.validate()`

### 2. Added Test Coverage
- **test/conf/bug_021_test.q** (new file)
  - Tests that ConfigurationErr is raised when `from_dict` is missing
  - Tests that ConfigurationErr is raised when `from_dict` throws an error
  - Verifies error messages are helpful and mention the actual problem

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
✗ BUG REPRODUCED: Caught AttrErr instead of ConfigurationErr
  Type:    AttrErr
  Message: Cannot call method 'str' on nil
```

### After Fix
```
✓ SUCCESS: Correctly raised ConfigurationErr
  Message: Configuration type for 'test.nomethod' must have static method from_dict
```

## Test Results

- ✅ Bug reproduction case (minimal_repo.q) now passes
- ✅ New test file (bug_021_test.q) passes: 2/2 tests
- ✅ All existing conf tests pass: 16/16 tests
- ✅ Full test suite passes: 2568/2568 tests (2560 passed, 8 skipped)
- ✅ No regressions detected

## Impact

This fix significantly improves the developer experience when creating configuration types for modules:

**Before**: Cryptic error message leads to confusion
```
AttrErr: Cannot call method 'str' on nil
```

**After**: Clear, actionable error message
```
ConfigurationErr: Configuration type for 'my.module' must have static method from_dict
```

Users now get immediate, helpful feedback about what they need to implement.
