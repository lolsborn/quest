# Bug #010: FIXED

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-05)

## Summary

Mutable type fields now work correctly! The `self.field = value` syntax properly updates instance fields in type methods.

## Test Results

All tests pass:
```bash
$ quest test_mutable_fields.q
=== Test: Mutable Type Fields ===
...
✅ PASSED: count=1 as expected
✅ PASSED: count=3 as expected
✅ PASSED: Instances maintain separate state
=== All Tests Passed ===
```

## Impact

This fix unblocks:
- ✅ Parsers with position tracking
- ✅ Iterators
- ✅ State machines
- ✅ Brainfuck benchmark implementation
- ✅ Any algorithm requiring mutable instance state

## What Was Fixed

Quest now properly handles mutations to type instance fields:

```quest
type Parser
    pub string: text
    pub int: pos

    fun next_char()
        let ch = self.text.slice(self.pos, self.pos + 1)
        self.pos = self.pos + 1  # ✅ This now works!
        ch
    end
end
```

The field `pos` correctly increments on each call.

## Next Steps

- Complete brainfuck benchmark using proper type-based implementation
- Implement other stateful algorithms that were previously blocked
