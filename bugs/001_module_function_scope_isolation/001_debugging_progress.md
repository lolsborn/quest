# Debugging Progress â€“ Module Function Scope Isolation

## Summary
- Introduced a shared `ModuleContext` for module functions so aliases retain members, module cache, and script path.
- Refined `call_user_function` to build scopes from that context, fixing the aliasing regression without cloning functions or leaking caller variables.
- Updated `scripts/test.q` to skip `docs`, `examples`, `scripts`, and `lib` when auto-discovering tests so the runner no longer imports unrelated helper files.
- Verified via the wrapper (`quest run test --no-color`) and release binary: only the known closure semantics failures remain, confirming the module aliasing issue is fixed.

## Details
1. Module context work keeps module functions tied to their environment; aliasing `test.describe` now works regardless of caller scope.
2. Test runner filtering avoids spurious imports when scanning from project root, so module aliasing tests no longer pick up the banner from `lib/this.q`.

## Remaining Follow-ups
- Add regression tests that alias module functions which perform relative imports to keep the ModuleContext machinery covered.
- Document the ModuleContext design in the developer guide to explain why module functions differ from regular closures.
